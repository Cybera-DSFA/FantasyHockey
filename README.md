# FantasyHockey
Location of our Fantasy Hockey draft code to teach data science.

# Work In Progress
Stay tuned! We will be updating this with our methodologies as well as updates as we get to them!

# Road map for future

1. Implementation of "live" team trading and maintenance so the robots can drop/add players as they see fit with a stream of data
2. Implementation of a version of this where we take subject matter expert opinion into account as well
3. Implementation of a version using machine learning rather than the current classical approach of constrained optimization 
4. Implementation of our own player performance estimations 
5. Add more human players
